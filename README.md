## 1. API Key
I contacted Bands In Town for a Student API at their [Support Page](https://www.artists.bandsintown.com/support/api-installation) and they replied on 21 Sep, 2020 with an API key (b2d0af8ea8bfb7288d2701b2d06e9eae) I can use for 3 months. This is used for all API calls in the application.
